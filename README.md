# Echo

A logic board simulation program that allows users to place/move any amount of logic gates and input pins, wire them up, and finally evaluate the circuit, generating a truth table.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing Echo you must have Godot version 4.X installed on your machine

### Installing

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Well35/Echo.git

2. Open Godot and select import
3. Locate the project.godot file cloned from this project

## Built With

* [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) - The engine used

## Why?

I built this project after being inspired by an assignment I had in a CS class, which was a simpler terminal only logic board program. It seemed like a fun idea developing something similar but with enhanced UX and interactivity all around.
